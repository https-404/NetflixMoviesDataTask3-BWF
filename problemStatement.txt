/**
 * Project Instructions:
 * 
 * Your friend suspects that movies are getting shorter and they've found some initial evidence of this.
 * Having peaked your interest, you will perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data
 * to understand what may be contributing to movies getting shorter over time. Your analysis will follow these steps:
 * 
 * 1. Load the CSV file and store as netflix_df.
 * 2. Filter the data to remove TV shows and store as netflix_subset.
 * 3. Investigate and subset the Netflix movie data, keeping only the columns "title", "country", "genre",
 *    "release_year", "duration", and saving this into a new DataFrame called netflix_movies.
 * 4. Filter netflix_movies to find the movies that are strictly shorter than 60 minutes, saving the resulting
 *    DataFrame as short_movies; inspect the result to find possible contributing factors.
 * 5. Using a for loop and if/elif statements, iterate through the rows of netflix_movies and assign colors of
 *    your choice to four genre groups ("Children", "Documentaries", "Stand-Up", and "Other" for everything else).
 *    Save the results in a colors list.
 * 6. Initialize a matplotlib figure object called fig and create a scatter plot for movie duration by release year
 *    using the colors list to color the points and using the labels "Release year" for the x-axis, "Duration (min)"
 *    for the y-axis, and the title "Movie Duration by Year of Release".
 * 7. After inspecting the plot, answer the question "Are we certain that movies are getting shorter?" by assigning
 *    either "yes" or "no" to the variable answer.
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment
 * and media companies. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect
 * opportunity to flex your exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend
 * has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data.
 * They believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. Using your friends initial research, you'll
 * delve into the Netflix data to see if you can determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and
 * explain some of the contributing factors, if any.
 * 
 * You have been supplied with the dataset netflix_data.csv, along with the following table detailing the column
 * names and descriptions. This data does contain null values and some outliers, but handling these is out of scope
 * for the project. Feel free to experiment after submitting!
 *

 * 
 * netflix_data.csv
